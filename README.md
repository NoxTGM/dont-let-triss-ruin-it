# Don't Let Triss Ruin It
Sources files of my first REDkit mod which was initially made as a joke and ended up with people actually enjoying it. In the unlikely case someone wants to build upon it here lies the files I modified in my mod.

## ⚙️ Installation

* Setup a new REDkit project
* Download the files and paste them inside your `workspace` folder
* Startup your project and open your `Asset Browser`
* Search for `q403_01_teleport_to_kaer_morhen.w2scene` and modify whatever you want
